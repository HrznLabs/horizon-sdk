## 2024-05-22 - Missing Input Validation in Financial Utilities
**Vulnerability:** `calculateFeeSplit` allowed `guildFeeBps` > 10000 (100%), resulting in negative `performerAmount`. This could cause downstream contract calls to revert or unexpected UI states.
**Learning:** Utility functions in SDKs are often treated as "pure logic" without defensive checks, assuming callers validate inputs. However, SDKs must be robust against invalid usage.
**Prevention:** Enforce input validation (e.g., basis point ranges 0-1500) within utility functions to guarantee valid output states (e.g., non-negative amounts).
