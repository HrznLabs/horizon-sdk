## 2026-02-05 - SDK UX is DX
**Learning:** For SDKs without UI components, "UX improvements" translate to Developer Experience (DX) enhancements, such as utility functions for formatting data (e.g. `formatDuration`), rather than logic validation or visual changes.
**Action:** Focus on "helper" utilities that make the developer's life easier when building UIs using the SDK.
